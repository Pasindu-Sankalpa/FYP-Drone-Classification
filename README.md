# Final Year Project
## Deep learning-based Drone Classification by utilizing Radar Cross Section Signatures

In recent years, drones have become a popular technology for various applications. However, the increasing usage of drones has raised concerns regarding privacy, safety, and security. One way to mitigate these concerns is to detect and classify drones using radar cross section (RCS) signatures at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies. This project proposes using deep learning algorithms to classify drones based on their RCS signatures.
