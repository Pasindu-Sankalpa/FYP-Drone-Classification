# Software Radar Project
This project aims to develop Software Defined Radars using Software Defined Radios and easy to obtain parts. This radar concept reduces the number of analog components needed to an amateur level. This project is developed using the Open-Source framework GNURadio Companion and Python for most of the tools.

## Currently Supported
- Single Frequency Continuous Wave Doppler Radar
- Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave Radar
